## Resetting the sensor

In Nova, you can click the three dots in the top-right corner to reset the application or access the file explorer for **deleting files**.

Click **_Application defaults_** to reset all the settings and jobs that were created.  

To delete all the images created during an educational training session, head to Nova's **_file explorer_**, right-click the _/public/Nova_ folder and click _Delete_.  

The internal memory is quite limited with less than one gigabyte, so it’s recommended to **clear all data after each training session**. Participants can perform this cleanup themselves, either before or after the lesson.
