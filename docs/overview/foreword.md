# Overview
## Foreword

This set is designed for educational institutions to explore digital image analysis using industrial sensors, with a strong focus on AI-based object analysis. It enables hands-on work with real industrial camera sensors and the same software used in actual industrial environments.  

The **InspectorP621** camera captures images of objects and performs internal analysis. Its preinstalled **Nova sensor app** provides a variety of tools that can be used individually or in combination to determine subsequent processing steps for a workpiece. Particularly noteworthy are the AI-powered tools, which open up new possibilities in quality control. These include training and executing anomaly detection, classification, and object instance detection. For demanding applications, neural networks for classification can be trained not only directly on the sensor but also in the **SICK cloud**.  

### These experimental instructions are intended for training participants or students to:
- Become familiar with the sensor and its software environment
- Experiment with different objects and analysis tools
- Gain practical experience with industrial hardware and software
- Solve various quality control and processing tasks
